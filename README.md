## Quick Start Guide

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/WillGolden80742/nodeWPP.git
    cd nodeWPP
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Configure Chrome Executable Path:**

    *   **Important:**  You need to specify the path to the Chrome executable. Open `index.js` and update the `executablePath` configuration in the `puppeteer` settings.  **This step is mandatory** for the application to function correctly.

        ```javascript
        const client = new Client({
            authStrategy: new LocalAuth(),
            puppeteer: {
                headless: true,
                executablePath: 'C:\\Program Files\\Google\\Chrome\\Application\\chrome.exe', // <-- **MANDATORY: Update this path!**
                args: ['--no-sandbox', '--disable-setuid-sandbox']
            }
        });
        ```

    *   **Path Verification:**  Ensure the path points to the Chrome executable on your system.  An incorrect path will prevent the application from working.

4.  **Start the Application:**

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

5.  **Access the Web Interface:**

    *   Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`.

6.  **Authenticate with WhatsApp:**

    *   A QR code will be displayed in your terminal. Scan this code using the WhatsApp application on your mobile phone to authenticate.

## Usage Instructions

1.  **Importing Contacts:**
    *   Click the "Selecione o arquivo" button to upload a CSV or VCF file.
    *   **For CSV Files:**  Select the columns corresponding to "Nome" (Name) and "Telefone" (Phone Number) from the dropdown menus.

2.  **Adding Contacts Manually:**
    *   Use the "Adicionar Contato" section. Enter the contact's name and phone number, then click the "+" button.

3.  **Composing Messages:**
    *   Use the message text area to write your message. Use the `[greeting]` placeholder for personalized greetings and `[name]` for the contact's name.

        *   **Example:** `OlÃ¡ [name], [greeting]!  We have an exclusive offer for you.`

4.  **Selecting Recipients:**
    *   Select contacts to send the message to by checking the checkboxes in the contact list.
    *   Use "Selecionar Todos" and "Desmarcar Todos" to quickly select or deselect all contacts.

5.  **Sending Messages:**
    *   Ensure "Modo de Teste" is checked for simulated sending.
    *   Click the "Enviar Mensagem" button.

6.  **Reviewing Results:**
    *   A modal window will display the status (success/error), contact name, and sent message for each contact.

## Important Considerations and Best Practices

*   **WhatsApp Web.js is Unofficial:** This project uses an unofficial API. Use it responsibly and in compliance with WhatsApp's terms of service. WhatsApp may change its policies or API structure, potentially affecting the functionality of this application.
*   **Correct Chrome Executable Path:** The `executablePath` setting in `index.js` must accurately point to your Chrome installation.
*   **Avoid Spamming:** Do not send mass messages in a short period. This could lead to your account being flagged or banned. Implement delays or throttling mechanisms.
*   **Use Test Mode:** Always test messages in "Modo de Teste" to avoid errors.
*   **CSV Encoding:** Ensure CSV files are properly encoded (UTF-8 or ISO-8859-1) to prevent character encoding issues. The application uses ISO-8859-1 by default.
*   **Phone Number Cleaning:**  The application removes non-numeric characters from phone numbers. Adjust the cleaning logic if needed.
